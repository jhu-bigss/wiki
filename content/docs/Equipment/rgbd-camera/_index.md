**Field of View**

At the same resolution, the D415 has more pixels per-degree, since it has the same number of pixels in a narrower field of view. While this may not matter in some cases, such as object avoidance or people detection, when accuracy is the number one consideration, for example in 3D scanning, the D415 will provide a better, more accurate scan.  In short, the D415 is more than twice as accurate as the D435.
