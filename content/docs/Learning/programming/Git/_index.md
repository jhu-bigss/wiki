# Git
git is a version control system. It is used to track changes in files and to collaborate with other people.

The best descriptions and tutorials are on the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

## Useful commands, tips, tricks
- Use the git lens extension for VSCode. It is very useful for viewing the history of the files.
- Sometimes, you want to move files from one repository to another, but keep the file history. You should use the tool called [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo). It is a python script, easy to use, and has great documentation. This is much better than wrote copy-pasting of files, because you can keep the history of the files.
